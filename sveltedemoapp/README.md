## Tutorial outline

This demo project is intended to accompany a 10-minute video tutorial that teaches the syntax and best practices of API calls in a simple Svelte 5 site. The full tutorial will cover the following:

* Starting a new Svelte 5 project
* Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation
* The new <code>$scope</code> _rune_ of Svelte 5, not yet released but currently available in the preview version
* CORS errors from front-end API calls
* CORS solution with back-end API call and the <code>+server.js</code> file
* using environment variables in Svelte to separate API keys from code base

## Thoughts...

* Svelte 5 hasn't been released yet, but it will be soon. This could mean that now is a perfect time for an entire Svelte course, one that incorporates all the new content. By the time the course is ready for deployment, Svelte 5 might be released. It's a bit risky because specs could change, yet Svelte is gaining a lot of traction in the dev community.
